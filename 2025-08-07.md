### What is an ADT(Abstract Data Type)
It's a mathematical model in contrast with data structure which are concrete representations of data.
ADTs can be implemented by **arrays** and **linked lists**.
**Linked List** (and its variations) can be used as the underlying data structure to implement List, Stack, Queue, and Deque ADTs
