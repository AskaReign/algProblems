### What is an ADT(Abstract Data Type)
It's a mathematical model in contrast with data structure which are concrete representations of data.
ADTs can be implemented by **arrays** and **linked lists**. </br>
**Linked List** (and its variations) can be used as the underlying data structure to implement List, Stack, Queue, and Deque ADTs.
- **Linked list** uses pointers/references to allow items/data to be **non-contiguous** in memory (that is the main difference with a simple array).
- Pure (Singly) Linked List applications are surprisingly rare as the simpler resizeable compact array (vector) can do the job better. However, the basic concept of Linked List that allows the vertices to be **non-contiguous** in memory makes it an excellent resize-able data structure for the next two other Abstract Data Types: Stack and Queue.
